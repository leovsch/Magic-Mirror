# Magic-Mirror

My implementation of the magic mirror web page :-)

So far it contains:
- A clock
- A news feed from the dutch news website www.nu.nl
- Weahter forcast using the openweathermap api.
- Greeting that dissapears after 10 seconds.

The webpage is an angular web app using angular version 1.5.8.
