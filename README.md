# Magic-Mirror

My implementation of the magic mirror web page :-)

So far it contains:
- A clock
- A news feed from the dutch news website www.nu.nl
- Weahter forcast using the openweathermap api.
- Greeting that dissapears after 10 seconds.

The webpage is an angular web app using angular version 1.5.8.

Expanded with motion sensor wich detects when someone is in front of the mirror.
- When motion is detected pi turns screen on and starts playing     music
- When no motion is detected pi turns display off
